#### Other Files (that you don't need to look at)

__import_tar_files.py__ Code used to import files in the 'data' directory from an external source. 

__test_data.tbl__ Test data used in one of our unit tests. 

__To-Do.md__ was just to help us keep track of what we needed to do. Feel free to look at it for a more detailed distribution of work, but otherwise no need!

__Research.md__ was just for us to keep all our research in one place! All the relevant information in this file is also included in our paper.
