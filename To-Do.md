Systems of special interest and ways to test the limits of our MCMC and our model
  - HD 142, binary star system with 2-3 exoplanets
  - Generate fake data of a system with no exoplanets (&mu;=0, expect v(r)=constant)
  - Generate and place outliers into data (would require us to make a new child class)
  - Remove chunks of data to simulate equipment failure
  - Adding different kinds of noise to the data
