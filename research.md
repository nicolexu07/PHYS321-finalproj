## Radial Velocity

Ch. 5.1 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01629.pdf gives an expectation formula for the radial velocity in terms of 
* M: the mass of the star
* m: the mass of the exoplanet
* T: the orbital period of the exoplanet around the star
* _e_: the eccentricity of the orbit
* I: the angle between line of sight and the orbital angular momentum
* &omega;: the angle of pericenter
* &tau;: time of passage through pericenter
* v<sub>0</sub>: the mean radial velocity of the center of mass
